# Data sets

This folder contains selected data sets for topological data analysis.
They have been taken from the [repository of benchmark data sets for
graph kernels](http://graphkernels.cs.tu-dortmund.de), curated by TU
Dortmund.

# Re-running the analysis

If you want to re-run the complete analysis pipeline as presented in the
slides, please execute the `run_analysis` script. It will perform the
following steps:

1. Extract all data sets
2. Download a copy of [Aleph](https://github.com/Submanifold/Aleph), my
   framework for topological data analysis
3. Build the tools required for analysing the graphs
4. Run the analysis
